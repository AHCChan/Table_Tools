CONTENTS

Table Tools
v2.0

The new release introduces Multitool_For_Tables, an amalagamation of 
Table_to_Table, Add_Column, and Column_Operations.

clone" operation is all which is required for installation.

    (3.0.2) Join.py
    (1.1)   Multitool_For_Tables.py
    (3.1.1) Tally_Column.py

Supporting Modules:
    (1.0)   _Controlled_Print.py
    (2.7)   _Command_Line_Parser.py
    (1.1)   File_Reader.py
    (2.1)   Table_File_Reader.py

Deprecated:
    (1.0.1) Add_Column.py
    (1.0.1) Column_Operations.py
    (4.1)   Table_to_Table.py


REQUIREMENTS

These programs run in Python 2. They will not work properly with Python 3.
Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.
Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS (SETUP)

You don't need to know how to use git to get these programs, you can simply 
open the files in your online browser and copy their contents onto a local 
file on your computer with the same name. Ensure that these files are in the
same folder.



INSTRUCTIONS (RUN)

To run a program, open up a command line window and enter one of the following
command (substituting the appropriate file paths) to bring up the help doc:

    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Join.py -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Multitool_For_Tables.py
        -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Tally_Column.py -h
    
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Add_Column.py -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Column_Operations.py -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Table_to_Table.py -h

You should get a large wall of text explaining how to use the relevant program,
along with some examples.

Alternatively, the code in these files can be used as a module by other Python 
programs using standard import methods.
