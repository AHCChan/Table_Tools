REQUIREMENTS

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.
Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.
Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS (SETUP)

You don't need to know how to use git to get this program, nor the libraries 
which this program needs to run.

You can simply open the files:
    File_Reader.py
    Table_File_Reader.py
... in your online browser and copy their contents onto a local file on your
computer with the same name. Ensure that these files are in the same folder.

INSTRUCTIONS (RUN)

To run the program, open up a command line window and enter the following
command (substituting the appropriate file paths) to bring up the help doc:

    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\The\File\Sort_by_r2_BCode.py -h

You should get a large wall of text explaining how to use this program, along
with some examples.
