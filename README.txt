                    - People fortunate enough to be really, REALLY good at Regex



REQUIREMENTS

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.
Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.
Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.

Table_to_Table.py and Join.py are self-contained and don't require any
additional files. They can be run as-is. All others require supporting files
which will need to be obtained from other repositories. (See SETUP)



INSTRUCTIONS (SETUP)

You don't need to know how to use git to get these programs, nor the libraries 
which this program needs to run.

You can simply open the files:
    File_Reader.py
    Table_File_Reader.py
    _Command_Line_Parser.py
    _Controlled_Print.py

... in your online browser and copy their contents onto a local file on your
computer with the same name. Ensure that these files are in the same folder.

Supporting files are available at:
    https://github.com/AHCChan/File_Reader
    https://github.com/AHCChan/Python_Command_Line_Tools



INSTRUCTIONS (RUN)

To run a program, open up a command line window and enter one of the following
command (substituting the appropriate file paths) to bring up the help doc:

    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Table_to_Table.py -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Join.py -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Add_Column.py -h
    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\This\Folder\Tally_Column.py -h

You should get a large wall of text explaining how to use the relevant program,
along with some examples.

Alternatively, the in these files can be used as a module by other Python 
programs using standard import methods.
